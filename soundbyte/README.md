Read the file tutorial.md for instructions on opening the game in IntelliJ.

To develop Java applications in IntelliJ IDEA, you need the Java SDK (JDK). Download the OpenJDK from either https://jdk.java.net/

If the JDK is installed on your computer, but not defined in the IDE, select Add JDK and specify the path to the JDK home directory (for example, /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.0.1.jdk).

The game was developed by LibGDX game engine.

LibGDX projects are built and managed with the Gradle build tool, which is a build automation tool for multi-language software development.

Download LibGDX project setup tool: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/dist/gdx-setup.jar

Open up your command line tool, go to the download folder and run java -jar gdx-setup.jar

For now, just select the “Desktop” sub project and leave all the defaults and click Generate.
