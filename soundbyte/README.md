If the JDK is installed on your computer, but not defined in the IDE, select Add JDK and specify the path to the JDK home directory (for example, /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.0.1.jdk).

LibGDX projects are built and managed with the Gradle build tool, which is a build automation tool for multi-language software development.

Open up your command line tool, go to the download folder and run java -jar gdx-setup.jar

For now, just select the “Desktop” sub project and leave all the defaults and click Generate.
